Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
This project involves building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbial species that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that while a few microbial species are common across many individuals, the majority are relatively rare.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create an interactive dashboard using the D3.js library. The dashboard includes:

Horizontal Bar Chart: Displays the top 10 microbial species (Operational Taxonomic Units, or OTUs) found in an individual's navel.
Bubble Chart: Visualizes the relative abundance and distribution of all detected OTUs for a selected individual.
Metadata Panel: Shows demographic information for the selected individual.
The dashboard is designed to dynamically update based on user input, allowing users to select different individuals and view the corresponding data.

Deployment
The project is deployed using GitHub Pages, making it accessible online. Regular commits and thorough documentation, including this README, ensure the project's maintainability and ease of use.
